# Bank-campaign-dataset-insights

This task was given to ma as part of a datascience boot camp.  

## The brief

*This dataset corresponds to a bank's marketing campaign based on phone calls.
There are 41188 instances and 21 attributes in this dataset.
You are given multiple files corresponding to the clients.*

*Analyse the data. The ultimate goal of the campaign was to get customers to sign up to a product. Look at the data and try to make sense of it.*

* *what are the most interesting features and why?*
* *does the data need to be transformed or adjusted? why and how?*
* *from exploring the data, can you build a few key insights that could be shared with a data-curious executive who has not looked at the data?*
* *once you have pre-processed the data (aim of the exercise) what are your suggestions for the next steps (note: you do not need to do these next steps but rather imagine what could be done with the data now that you have explored it and make suggestions)*

So this is a data exploration exercise, not a modeling one.  I have performed all analysis in the insights notebook.
